# Appium Sudoku

Playing around with [Appium](https://appium.io/) and a Sudoku Android app called [Sodoku - Free & Online](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fassor.android.sudoku&hl=en_US).

Currently it reads in the games tiles, uses [pytesseract](https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract) to convert each tile image to text. And then once all the tiles are read in. Displays them in a nice grid.

Code is VERY messy.. but I will clean it up in future commits.
